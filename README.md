# React Web Sockets

## Overview

This is a personal project created with the goal of having my first contact with the websockets technology.

It's a MVP real time chat app made with react as the frontend UI and an express/socketio as the backend structure.

## How to use

This repo contains both frontend and backend, so to use it you'll need to:

1. Clone the repo into your machine
2. Inside the repo (root dir), run ```npm install```
3. Go into the server dir and ```npm install``` again to install the backend
4. Run the server in the server dir with ```node index.js```
5. Change dir into the root again and run the command ```npm run dev```

The login page is not fully implemented since it's a MVP so no auth is needed, simply click the login button and it will work

## Work in progress

This is a work in progress project, all the functionalities are not final and bugs are expected.

If you would like to collaborate, please feel free to do so.
